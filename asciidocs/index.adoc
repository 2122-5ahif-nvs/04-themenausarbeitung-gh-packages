== GitHub Packages
=== Quick Introduction:

TIP: https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/introduction-to-github-packages[GitHub Packages]

=== Information
GitHub Packages is a software package hosting service.
It allows you to publish your software publicly or privately. +

When using GitHub Packages you can integrate your software code and also the actual packages, to run the software in your GitHub Repository.
Just like that you have everything accessible in one place on GitHub.

== GitHub Container Registry

=== Quick Introduction:
TIP: https://github.blog/2020-09-01-introducing-github-container-registry[Cotainer Registry Docker Images] +

=== Information
The GitHub Container Registry contains your published docker image packages. +
It functions like DockerHub, but it offers functionality to integrate the images into your GitHub repository.

== Publishing your Image manually
=== Authenticate with Docker

First, you have to log into Docker with your Github-Credentials.
[source,bash]
----
docker login ghcr.io -u <github_username> --password
----
Afterwards, you will be asked to type in your password (github-token).

=== Build your image
The next step is to build your desired docker image. +

IMPORTANT: The image tagging is very important in this step!

This is what the image tag should look like:
[source,text]
----
ghcr.io/<gh_repository_owner>/<image_name>:<version>
----

Example:
[source,text]
----
ghcr.io/musikfreunde/leocode-backend:26.0
----
musikfreunde -> Repository owner, either a team or a user +
ghcr.io -> github-container registry url +
leocode-backend:26.0 -> The image name and version

Building the image:
[source,bash]
----
docker build -t ghcr.io/musikfreunde/leocode-backend:26.0 . <1>
----
<1> You can either name the image directly or tag it later.

=== Publish your image
The last step is to actually publish your image to the registry.
[source,bash]
----
docker push ghcr.io/musikfreunde/leocode-backend:26.0
----
== Publishing your Image with GitHub-Workflow/Actions
This way to publish is much more comfortable and allows you to test the image changes you made to the repo almost instantly after pushing them.

TIP: https://github.com/Musikfreunde/eazy-menue[Project used for this tutorial]

=== Create a Repository Secret
The repository secret is needed, so that GitHub Actions can login to your GitHub Account.
The secret value is one of your GitHub Login Tokens.

=== Create a Workflow File
CAUTION: Github Actions should be enabled by default, if not check in the Actions tab in your Repo settings.

* [*] Create a .github/workflows directory, if not present.

image::github-workflow-folder.png[]

* [*] Create a .yml file inside it

image::github-workflow-yml-file.png[]

=== The .yml File

[source,yaml]
----
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Publish EazyMenue Frontend and Backend

# Controls when the action will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: ['main']

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

----
<1> This represents your desired name of the docker image
<2> The working directory is where all the steps run, it represents a directory inside your repository. +
In my case there is a quarkus project inside this directory.
<3> This step clones your GitHub Repository to the build container.
<4> In this step your login token is used to log in into the GitHub Container Registry.
<5> This step builds your desired docker image, preferably with a Dockerfile.
<6> In this step your Container Registry image name gets created like we did in the manual tutorial.
<7> The last step pushes the image to the registry, where now it will be accessible within you GitHub Repository.
<8> This decides which virtual container gets used to build your image.

== Pushing to your GitHub Repository
In my case everytime I push onto the main branch the workflow gets executed.

It should look like this:

.GitHub Actions tab within your repo
image::actions-tab-repo.png[]

When it's done:

.Succesful Actions Run
image::action-run-done.png[]

== Your published GitHub Packages
Now the packages should be visible in your packages tab.

=== Settings

In the package view you can make all your necessary settings like: +

* assign a repository to your package
* make the package public/private
* ...
